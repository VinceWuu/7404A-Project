This project aims to reproduce the paper：Domain Generalization and Adaptation Using Low Rank Exemplar SVMs’.

The code is mainly developed using MATLAB

In the project we have trained and tested domain generalization on the Office-Caltech dataset based on the Algorithms1 from the paper.
We choose A, C as the source domain and D, W as the target domain.

You can run the whole project by run demo.m . We saved the trained model in the model folder, so you can quickly observe the test results.

If you need to train model by yourself, please delete the model folder and re-run the demo.m, of course the training may take a few hours.
